#Eat Da Burger

![alt tag](https://github.com/avish2/burger/blob/master/public/img/screenshot.png)

##Objective

The objective of this project was to start to build full-stack applications with visually appealing front end work that functions off the information on a database (MySQL). This application puts to use many softwares including, Node.js [Handlebars, Express, Body Parser, Method-Override], MySQL and ORM framework. 

##How It Works

The app is a simple interactive page that allows you to "consume" burgers from a pre-made list as well as any that the user adds. Once consumed, the burger name is transfered to a seperate "eaten" list. A function to delete burgers off that list is in the works.

[Heroku Demo](#)

On the server side of the application, every added and consumed burger is logged. Attached to the log is the date and time and an ID number from the database. 

	RawDataPacket {
	    id:8,
        burger_name: 'Whopper',
        devoured: 1,
        date: 2017-08-29T21:36:08.000Z },
